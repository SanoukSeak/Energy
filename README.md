# Energy

## Time-series Forecasting, Monte Carlo Simulation, Optimization Algorithm, Regression Model

Energy is what powers the economy. For example, By analyzing historical data with time-series forecasting, businesses can predict energy prices and demand fluctuations. Also, Monte Carlo simulation assesses risk exposure and potential returns, offering insights into optimal asset allocation. Optimization algorithms identify the best mix of energy assets, while regression models evaluate the impact of external factors like weather or policy changes.
